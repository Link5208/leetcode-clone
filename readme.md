## Overview
In the current phase, there is only a database on Supabase.

- The `create_db.sql` file would create the necessary tables (on PostgresSQL)
- The `insert_sample.py` would get the sample problems from "./sample_problems"
and insert them into the database (problems and testcases)

The database on Supabase (which you can access with API URL and key inside
`insert_sample.py`) already has those data and ready to use.
